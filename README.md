* There's a good chance that the CMakeList is indefinitely broken, i had no idea how to do proper cmake at the time this was written so a lot of bad practices are present which includes the ghetto way of linking target directories.
* A bunch syntax in here is non standard, i thought it would be funny to make it so anyone who isn't using clang would have a hard time.
